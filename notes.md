Phase 1: Planning and Setup
Define Project Scope:

List core features (e.g., news fetching, user authentication, customizable feed).

Choose tech stack (React.js for frontend, Node.js for backend, MongoDB for database).

Select a news API (e.g., NewsAPI).

Set Up Development Environment:

Install tools: VSCode, Node.js, npm, Git, Postman.

Create a GitHub repository for version control.

Set up folder structure: client/ (frontend), server/ (backend), .env, .gitignore, README.md.

Phase 2: Backend Development
Set Up the Backend:

Initialize Node.js backend in the server/ folder.

Install required packages: Express, CORS, body-parser, dotenv, Axios.

Create a basic Express server in server/index.js.

Add a route to fetch news from the API using Axios.

Test the backend using Postman.

Phase 3: Frontend Development
Set Up the Frontend:

Initialize React.js frontend in the client/ folder using Create React App.

Install Axios for API calls.

Fetch news data from the backend in src/App.js.

Style the frontend using CSS or a library like Bootstrap.

Phase 4: Add Core Features
User Authentication:

Set up Firebase Authentication for login/signup.

Create login and signup components.

Customizable News Feed:

Add category filters (e.g., technology, sports).

Save user preferences in local storage or database.

Phase 5: Advanced Features
Sentiment Analysis (Optional):

Integrate an NLP library (e.g., spaCy) to analyze article sentiment.

Display sentiment scores or color-coded indicators.

Trending Topics:

Detect trending keywords using algorithms.

Display trending topics in a sidebar or dedicated section.

Dark Mode:

Add a dark mode toggle using CSS variables or a library like styled-components.

Phase 6: Testing and Debugging
Test the Application:

Test frontend using Jest and React Testing Library.

Test backend APIs using Postman.

Debug and fix any issues.

Phase 7: Deployment
Deploy the Backend:

Deploy backend to Heroku:

Push backend code to Heroku using Git.

Deploy the Frontend:

Deploy frontend to Netlify or Vercel:

Build the frontend using npm run build.

Deploy using Netlify or Vercel CLI.

Phase 8: Documentation and Submission
Write Documentation:

Update README.md with project description, features, setup instructions, and screenshots.

Create a demo video showcasing the project.

Submit the Project:

Push final code to GitHub.

Share the live project link with your team or instructor.
